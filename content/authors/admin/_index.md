# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Siheng Chen is an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, he was a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) and an autonomy engineer at Uber Advanced Technologies Group, working on the perception and prediction systems of self-driving cars. Before joining the industry, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University. He received the doctorate in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University(CMU) in 2016, where he also received two masters degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Machine Learning, respectively. He received his bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering in 2011 from Beijing Institute of Technology, China. His paper “Discrete signal processing on graphs: Sampling theory” won the 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award. His co-authored paper received the Best Student Paper Award at IEEE GlobalSIP 2018.

His research mainly focuses on graph-structured data science, whose goal is to develop theories and algorithms to analyze large-scale data associated with complex and irregular structures. His research is conducted from three aspects: theory (graph signal processing), algorithms (graph neural networks), and applications (autonomous systems, human behavior analysis, 3D point cloud processing, and smart infrastructure).
